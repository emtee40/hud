Currently no major new features are planned, only bugfixes.
This may change for the following reasons:

* OsmAnd (or other navigation app) provides acccess to driving aids via intent
  broadcast.
* Remote control from steering becomes available.
* People will be massively sticking their tablets under windshield and demanding
  more data displayed. It is probably possible to display more than one number
  on tablet without sacrificing high readability.

Minor enhacements possible:

* settings activity
* different units
* disable vibrator
